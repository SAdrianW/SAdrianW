# Shaun Wellman

I am an avid and passionate creator. I find my greatest joy in life comes from making things that either bring joy to others or that stand out as being different. 
The forms that my creations can take are many and varied. I have produced everything from small scale sculptures to fully painted house interiors to code based websites and games. 

Having created so many various things and tried my hand at so many different disciplines I find that while I have picked up a lot of useful skills, I have yet to find my place in the world. 
I believe that I have found it now with Software Engineering, due to the depth and breadth of scope of potential projects that can be achieved.
